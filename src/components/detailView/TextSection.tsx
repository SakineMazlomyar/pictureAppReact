            Forests are the dominant terrestrial ecosystem of Earth, and are distributed around the globe.[7] Forests account for 75% of the gross primary production of the Earth's biosphere, and contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass. Net primary production is estimated at 21.9 gigatonnes carbon per year for tropical forests, 8.1 for temperate forests, and 2.6 for boreal forests.[7]
            
            Forests at different latitudes and elevations form distinctly different ecozones: boreal forests near the poles, tropical forests near the equator and temperate forests at mid-latitudes. Higher elevation areas tend to support forests similar to those at higher latitudes, and amount of precipitation also affects forest composition.

                A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and, 
                consequently, living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. 
                The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes 
                of denudation. About one-third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. 
                This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes 
                called polar deserts or "cold deserts". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation 
                that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.

                surface or region spangled with stars. During the day, the Sun can be seen in 
                the sky unless obscured by clouds. In the night sky (and to some extent during the day) 
                the Moon, planets and stars are visible in the sky. Some of the natural phenomena seen in 
                the sky are clouds, rainbows, and aurorae. Lightning and precipitation can also be seen in the 
                sky during storms. Birds, insects, aircraft, and kites are often considered to fly in the sky.
